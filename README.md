# Subform

Create and submit form with clean and minimal UI

## Assumptions

1. using local storage to save the draft and view it. Using appwrite to save the published form. Using two different method just to showcase the difference in saving the draft and publishing the form.
2. Displaying the alert messages if user get's any error or misses to fill the form name or any other cases
3. Using the peerlist icons copied from the figma file which pose some restrictions.
4. One of the input type have discrepancies in the assignment doc and the figma design. In this project the assignment notion doc is referred and hence the input type 'Number' is considered instead of 'Date'
5. Sequence in which new input type blocks are added. The blocks are added above the 'Add Question' button but the next block is added below the earlier one.
6. Preview, Save as Draft and Publish form buttons are enabled as soon as any one question block is added.
